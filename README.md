### This repository contains files for the final project for Mechanical Engineering 107 at UC Berkeley.

A car with a platform, where the platform stays horizontal regardless of the car’s angle of 
inclination with respect to the ground. Programmed microcontroller to receive and process 
the data from a 9 degrees of freedom inertial measurement unit (IMU), and to control a 
servo motor, attached to the car’s platform. Implemented first and second order 
complimentary filters and a Kalman filter to accurately measure the tilt angle of the car.
